# Runs the whole simulation

# Requirement : I need to add more tables, without running the basic simulation again. The thing is that sampling size and network size might need to be adjusted.  

def init_network(config):
    network size
    node: speed,
    return network


def run(network, stop):
    # Save to Google
    while(!stop):
        for nodes in network:
            t_run  = speed()
            t_wait = barrier()
            t_comm = network()
            save t's to database on the way
            node.count += 1
    return
